The ClassCastException occurs when an @link tag appears in the first
sentence of a doc comment, when it inherits documentation from 
a private member, and when that tag's first argument begins with a 
hash character '#':
  
  This is the first sentence {@link #myMethod}.
  
A workaround for the ClassCastException is to change the reference
to include the class name:

  This is the first sentence {@link Myclass#myMethod}.
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The above workaround doesn't seem to work.  It seems necessary
to remove *all* link tags of that form.

(1) When I remove the first-sentence-occurances of {@link #...} the 
    ClassCastException does not go away.  
(2) When I add a first-sentence-occurance of {@link #...} to a version the 
    JAVA source that runs properly, the ClassCastException does not arise.

Nevertheless it has something to do with the {@link #...} tags, 'cause when
I remove *all* occurances, of {@link #...} the ClassCastException does go away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a class auto-inherits methods from a parent class, there can be relative
links that start with the '#' character.  These links will still point to the
parent class, which is wrong.  We try to redirect the link to the right place on
line 1338 of HtmlDocletWriter like this:
